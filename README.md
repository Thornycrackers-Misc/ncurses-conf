# Explanation
This is a simple ncurses program I made for fun just to check out ncurses more or less. 

The main idea was to have seperate menus that contained different actions such as editing
files, sshing to a host, or running arbitrary commands. You can add to each menu's array 
to add to the menus and you use vim-key navigation around the menu (hjkl). You can also hit
tab while the program menu to switch ssh to ssh-copy-id do that you can add your keys and 
not have to worry about remembering the password.
